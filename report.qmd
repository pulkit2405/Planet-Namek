## Introduction

Over period of time, significant changes in healthcare quality, economic growth, and population trends have shaped global well-being. This dashboard explores four key indicators that provide valuable insights into these transformations. Maternal Mortality Trends (2000 - 2020) higlight progress in reducing maternal deaths worldwide, while the relationship between GDP per Capita and Life Expectancy demonstrates how economic growth influences longevity. Additionally, Hospital Bed Availability per 1,000 people helps identify well-equiped healthcare systems, and Birth Rate Trends across Countries shed light on poppulatiom dynamics and their long term implications. By analyzing these factors, we can uncover actionable strategies to enhance healthcare outcomes and drive sustainable development.

```{python}
import pandas as pd
from report_helpers import maternal_mortality_helper

df = pd.read_csv('./data/unicef_indicator_2.csv')
meta_data_df = pd.read_csv('./data/unicef_metadata.csv')

df = pd.merge(
    df,
    meta_data_df[['country', 'time_period', 'Population, total']],
    on = ['country', 'time_period'],
    how = 'left'
)

maternal_mortality_helper(df)
```

Between 2000 and 2020, the world saw a 34% reduction in maternal deaths, marking a significant achievement in global health. This decline not only saved countless lives but also contributed to economic growth by improving women's health and productivity. Healthier mothers mean stronger families and more stable communities, ultimately reducing the financial strain on healthcare systems. In regions with high birth rates, this progress also helped manage population growth more sustainably, as better maternal care is often linked to lower fertility rates and improved child survival.

## Correlation b/w Life Expectancy and Hospital Beds
```{python}
from report_helpers import correlation_HB_LE_helper


df = pd.read_csv('./data/unicef_metadata.csv')
correlation_HB_LE_helper(df)
```

The animated visualization of life expectancy versus hospital beds across countries reveals a strong positive correlation between healthcare infrastructure and public health outcomes over time. Countries with a higher number of hospital beds per 1,000 people generally exhibit greater life expectancy, emphasizing the importance of accessible medical care. The animation also highlights regional disparities — some countries remain clustered in the lower ranges of both metrics, pointing to persistent health system limitations. Additionally, missing data points shown in lighter shades make gaps in global health reporting visible, which could hinder effective policy-making. This visualization underscores the need for continuous investment in healthcare infrastructure and better data collection to address global health inequalities.

## Change in Birth Rate vs GDP per Capita
```{python}
from report_helpers import birth_rate_vs_GDP_helper


df = pd.read_csv('./data/unicef_metadata.csv')
birth_rate_vs_GDP_helper(df)
```

<br>
The animated scatter plot reveals a clear inverse relationship between GDP per capita and crude birth rate across countries over time. Nations with higher GDP per capita generally exhibit lower birth rates, reflecting how economic development often correlates with better access to education, healthcare, and family planning. Countries with missing GDP data are shown in gray, providing transparency without disrupting the visual flow. This approach allows for a complete view of each country’s demographic evolution while still signaling data limitations. Such visualizations are crucial for policymakers and researchers to identify regions where economic growth may be linked to declining fertility rates — a trend that can significantly influence long-term population strategies and development planning.

## Vaccination Coverage
```{python}
from report_helpers import vaccination_coverage_helper

df = pd.read_csv('./data/unicef_indicator_1.csv')
df = df[['country', 'time_period', 'obs_value', 'current_age']]

df2 = pd.read_csv('./data/unicef_metadata.csv')

df = pd.merge(
    df,
    df2[['country', 'time_period', 'Population, total']],
    on = ['country', 'time_period'],
    how = 'left'
)

vaccination_coverage_helper(df)
```

The treemap visualization of vaccination coverage in relation to population size provides a nuanced perspective on global immunization trends. Countries with larger populations—such as India, China, and the United States—visibly occupy more space in the treemap due to the scale of their populations. However, the analysis indicates that a higher population does not necessarily correspond to higher vaccination coverage. While several high-population countries exhibit commendable immunization rates, others demonstrate comparatively lower coverage, underscoring disparities in healthcare access and public health infrastructure. Temporal trends further reveal incremental improvements in vaccination coverage across many regions.
